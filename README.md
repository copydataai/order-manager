# Order manager

## Problem
As a chef with high level of orders, we tend to confuse what is the priority for that moment, and what would be the next order.
before collapse the system and managing to the waiters.

## TODO
- [ ] Create an API to manager and chef roles
- [ ] chef role can read orders and see if its done
- [ ] manager role can add orders but just modify in less than 2 min before the order
- [ ] Add whisper to read the orders
- [ ] Add whisper to interact with priority of orders
